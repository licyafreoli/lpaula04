# 📁 Project Description of Programming Activities

This repository contains a series of Python programs from the programming logic module, 
lesson 04, organized into different folders. Each folder contains a programming activity described below:

## Activity Descriptions

### Activity 1: Multiplication Table of a Number
- **File**: `atividade1/atvd.py`
- The program prompts the user for a number and uses a `for` loop to display the multiplication table of that number from 1 to 10.

### Activity 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 100
- **File**: `atvd2/main.py`
- This program uses a `for` loop to sum all the numbers from 1 to 100 and displays the final result.

### Activity 3: Character by Character
- **File**: `atvd3/main.py`
- The program prompts the user for a word and uses a `for` loop to display each character of the word on a separate line.

### Activity 4: Countdown from 10 to 1
- **File**: `atvd4/main.py`
- This program counts down from 10 to 1 using a `for` loop and displays "Happy New Year!" at the end.

### Activity 5: Counting Positive and Negative Numbers
- **File**: `atvd5/main.py`
- The program prompts the user for 10 numbers and uses a `for` loop with a conditional statement to count how many are positive and how many are negative.

### Activity 6: Sum of Even Numbers
- **File**: `atvd6/main.py`
- The program uses a `for` loop to sum all the even numbers from 1 to 50 and displays the final result.

### Activity 7: Counting Vowels in a Word
- **File**: `atvd7/main.py`
- This program prompts the user for a word and uses a `for` loop with a conditional statement to count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) the word contains.

### Activity 8: Average Grade Calculation
- **File**: `atvd8/main.py`
- The program prompts the user for 5 student grades, uses a `for` loop to sum the grades, and a conditional statement to calculate the average and determine if the student is "Approved" (average >= 6) or "Rejected" (average < 6).

### Activity 9: Check Even and Odd Numbers with Interruption
- **File**: `atvd09/main.py`
- The program uses a `for` loop to count from 1 to 20, checking whether each number is even or odd. The loop is interrupted upon encountering the number 15.

### Activity 10: Count Positive and Negative Numbers with Interruption
- **File**: `atvd10/main.py`
- The program prompts the user to enter up to 10 numbers and counts how many are positive and how many are negative. The loop is interrupted if the number 0 is entered.

### Activity 11: Check Multiples of 5 and Stop
- **File**: `atvd11/main.py`
- The program prints the numbers from 1 to 30, checks if they are multiples of 5, and stops the loop if the number is greater than 20.

### Activity 12: Sum of Numbers with Discount
- **File**: `atvd12/main.py`
- The program prompts the user for 5 product prices, calculates the total, and applies a 10% discount if the total exceeds 100. The loop is interrupted with `break` when the total reaches this limit.
